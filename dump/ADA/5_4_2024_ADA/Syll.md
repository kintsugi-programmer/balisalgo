Dear students,
The end-semester exam will be for 3 hours, from 2-5 pm on 4th May.

The syllabus will cover all topics from the beginning to the end. Here is the list of broad topics that were covered in this course.

(i) Growth functions.
(ii) Recurrence relations.
(iii) Divide and Conquer.
(iv) Dynamic Programming.
(v) Applications of Topological Sort in DAG.
(vi) Applications and Conceptual Understanding of Shortest Paths, Spanning Trees in Graphs.
(vii) Applications of Network Flow.
(viii) Understanding of the concepts of Polynomial-time Reductions and NP-Completeness, e.g. proving that a given problem is in NP, giving a reduction from one problem to another, and given a reduction, finding out why that reduction is wrong.

Take a look at the suggested problems that were shared with you. Understanding the algorithms (along with their correctness) discussed in the class would also give you good insight before you appear in the exam.


All the best!
