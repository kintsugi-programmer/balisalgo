If you are using the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) distribution, you can follow these steps to compile and run C or C++ programs:

### Step 1: Install MinGW

If you haven't installed MinGW, you can download and install it by following these steps:

1. Visit the [MinGW website](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) and click on the "Downloads" link.
2. Download the installer appropriate for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

### Step 2: Write a C or C++ Program

Create a simple C or C++ program using a text editor. For example, you can use Notepad on Windows or any code editor of your choice.

Let's create a "Hello, World!" program. Open your text editor and enter the following code:

For C (`hello.c`):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

For C++ (`hello.cpp`):
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Step 3: Open a Command Prompt

Open a command prompt on your system. You can do this by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter.

### Step 4: Navigate to the Directory

Navigate to the directory where your C or C++ source file is located using the `cd` command. For example:

```bash
cd path\to\your\source\code
```

### Step 5: Compile the Program

#### For C:
```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

#### For C++:
```bash
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```

The `-o` flag specifies the output file (`hello` in this case).

### Step 6: Run the Compiled Program

Run the compiled program using the following command:

```bash
hello
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've successfully compiled and run a simple C or C++ program using MinGW on Windows.
